# Pimoroni_explorer_rp2350_experiments
experiments / test code i used for [Pimoroni Explorer (rp2350)](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer?variant=42092697845843)

## pimoroni_explorer_display_arduinogfx
provides Arduino_PimoroniPAR8 and Arduino_ST7789_Parallel drivers to be used with arduinogfx so we can use the display from the board in arduino ide. 
It has been created with the help of claude.ai and is based on the display driver from pimoroni itself (https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/drivers/st7789)
It seemed to work fine with my testings

The following libraries are required for this example to compile:
- **[arduino_pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)**: to be able to use the pimoroni explorer board in arduino ide
- **Arduino_GFX_Library**: for doing actual gfx drawing

## pimoroni_explorer_mixedtones
mixedtones is a library / set of functions to play multiple tones, potentially played at the same time using a speaker pin and pwm. 
I mainly needed this for the port of the crisp game lib portable. The example plays some sound effects and little musical pieces. The (example) code
was largely created with the help of claude.ai and seems to work fine.

The following libraries are required for this example to compile:
- **[arduino_pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)**: to be able to use the pimoroni explorer board in arduino ide

## pimoroni_explorer_sensor_stick
Reads the sensor values from the [Multi Sensor Stick](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/multi-sensor-stick?variant=42169525633107) attached to the explorer board
It was generated by claude.ai

The following libraries are required for this example to compile:
- **[arduino_pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)**: to be able to use the pimoroni explorer board in arduino ide
- **Arduino_GFX_Library**: for doing actual gfx drawing
- **Adafruit_BME280**: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Altitude
- **Adafruit_LSM6DS3TRC**: Accelerometer, Gyroscope (motion/tilt)
- **Adafruit_Unified_Sensor**: dependency for sensors
- **Adafruit_BusIO**: dependency for I2C/SPI

## pimoroni_explorer_weather_forecast
a weather station and clock for your Pimoroni Explorer RP2350 with the Multi-Sensor Stick. It displays temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and dew point from the BME280 sensor.
The main feature is intelligent weather forecasting based on pressure trends. It samples pressure every 5 minutes and stores 12 readings to track hourly changes. By analyzing whether pressure is rising or falling, it predicts conditions like "Rain Coming," "Fair Weather," or "Storm Warning" with color-coded weather icons.
The display shows date and time in DD/MM/YYYY format that you can set using the ABXY buttons. Press A to enter setting mode, B to cycle through fields (hours, minutes, day, month, year), then X to increment or Y to decrement. The clock automatically handles midnight rollovers and leap years.
To prevent LCD burn-in, a screensaver activates after 5 minutes of inactivity, moving the clock and basic weather info to new random positions every 10 seconds. Any button press exits the screensaver. The backlight is set to 65 for optimal visibility while reducing power consumption.
